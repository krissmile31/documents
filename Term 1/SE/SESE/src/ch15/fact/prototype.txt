Prototype pattern:
=================
Specify the kinds to objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create
new objects by copying this prototype.

It consists of a Client class and a Prototype interface that is to 
be implemented by concrete prototype classes specific to the needs of a given application.  

From example, a GraphicTool class of a musical editor application would 
take a concrete Prototype object called MusicalNote to manipulate this object on 
a graphical user interface.
