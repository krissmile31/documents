Builder pattern:
=================
Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction 
process can create different different representations.

It consists of a Directory class (the client) and a Builder interface that is to 
be implemented by concrete builder classes. 

From example, a RTFReader class would uses different TextConverter such as ASCIIConverter, TeXConverter, 
etc. to convert a given document without having to know these specific converters.
